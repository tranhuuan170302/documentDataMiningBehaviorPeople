Contouring the learning rate over time is similar to contouring the speed of a car according to road conditions. On smooth, broad roads such as a highway, we can increase our speed (learning rate), but on narrow, hilly, or valley roads, we must slow down. Keep in mind that “...a high learning rate... [indicates] the system contains too much kinetic energy and the parameter vector bounces around chaotically, unable to settle down into the deeper, but narrower parts of the loss function” (see Karpathy’s Notes for cs231n). Such decay makes the learned network resistant to random fluctuations that could possibly reverse the learning. Learning rate decay\n","\n","Non-adaptive learning rates can be suboptimal. Learning rate decay can be brought about through reducing decay by some constant factor every few epochs, or by exponential decay, in which the decay takes a mathematical form of the exponential every few epochs. “Decay” is often considered a negative concept, and in the current case of learning rate decay it’s a negative, too: it refers to how much the learning rate is decreasing. In a car, for instance, we decrease the speed to suit the road and traffic conditions; this deacceleration can be understood as a “decay” in the velocity of the car. Think of a local minima as a speeding ticket, a toll or traffic light, or traffic congestion—something that basically increases the time taken to reach the destination. The RMSProp adaptive learning rate by Tieleman and Hinton, 2012, keeps a moving average of the squared gradient for each weight to normalize the current gradient. Figure 1 shows the comparison of different optimization techniques under similar hyperparameter settings:\n","\n","\n","Figure 1. It is imperative to selectively increase or decrease learning rate as training progresses in order to reach the global optimum or the desired destination. A good way to generate this plot is by overlaying the loss per epoch curve for different sets of parameters. Cross entropy’s niceties include a log term, making it more granular, while taking into account the closeness of the predicted value with the target. Plotting the cross entropy function might be more interpretable due to the log term simply because the learning process is mostly an exponential process taking the form of an exponential shape. Experimenting with different learning rates\n","\n","Learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls the size of update steps. As seen in the plots of Figure 2, there is a lot of confusion or random noise with an increase in the learning rate. We can infer from the plots that a high learning rate is more likely to blow up the whole model, resulting in numerical instability such as overflows or underflows, which was also empirically noted while running these experiments.

Loss per epoch for different learning rates. Figure 2 shows the loss per epoch curve for different learning rates. Two different loss functions, the cross entropy and the classification error, are compared. When the learning rates are high, almost exponential jumps are seen (Learning rate 1 and .5). Each layer has a different fan-in or the number of inputs, that determines the overshoot effect caused by simultaneously updating the incoming weights of a unit aimed at correcting the same error (as is the case in the global learning rate). Hence, the appropriate learning rates can vary widely between weights. A fix for this issue involves setting a global learning rate and multiplying it by an appropriate local gain that is determined empirically for each weight. While using separate adaptive learning rates, either the entire batch should be used for learning, or larger mini-batches should be used in order to ensure the changes in the signs of the gradients are not mainly due to the sampling error of a mini-batch or random fluctuations. These per-weight adaptive learning rates can also be combined with momentum. As the network is pretrained, fine-tuning takes considerably less time to train, because the network has already acquired most of the information it needs and must only refine that knowledge during the fine-tuning phase. Conclusion\n","\n","In this article, we only briefly touched on a few things out of all the parameters in the parametric-multiverse of deep learning algorithms. We can always find a pre-trained model for the application we are developing, selectively add or delete parts of it, and ultimately fine-tune it for the application we need. And, if we contour our learning rate accurately, we reach our destination in good time.\n","\n","Creating better disaster recovery plans\n","=======================================\n","\n","Top N Summary\n","-------------\n","Five questions for Tanya Reilly: How service interdependencies make recovery harder and why it’s a good idea to deliberately and preemptively manage dependencies.I recently asked Tanya Reilly, Site Reliability Engineer at Google, to share her thoughts on how to make better disaster recovery plans.

But there can still be some forgotten components of the system that only run in one or two places. Parts of the system that are only used in disasters need the most testing, or they'll fail you when you need them. But someone needs to keep a big picture of what depends on what, because it can get very tangled very fast. You can even end up with things that indirectly depend on themselves—for example, a device that you need to configure to bring up the network, but you can't get to it while the network is down.

In the past years, however, breakthroughs in AI and deep learning have changed everything in the quest for speech recognition. Applying deep learning techniques enabled remarkable results. Today, we see the leap forward in development manifesting in a wide range of products, such as Amazon Echo, Apple Siri, and many more. In this post, I’ll review recent advances in speech recognition, examine the elements that have contributed to the rapid progress, and discuss the futureand how far we may be from solving the problem completely. Conversational AI encompasses two main categories: man-machine interface, and human-to-human interface. Machine perception and cognition\n","\n","In order to understand the challenges and the technologies behind conversational AI, we must examine the basic concepts in AI: machine perception and machine cognition. Speech recognition and profiling are machine perception technologies that use the sense of hearing. Machine cognition includes decision-making, expert systems, action taking, user intent, and more. In conversational AI, machine perception includes all speech analysis technologies, such as recognition and profiling, and machine cognition includes all the language understanding-related technologies, which are part of Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, before 2011 and the advent of deep learning, big data, and cloud computing, these solutions were far from sufficient for mass adoptions and commercial use. Together with more data, available cloud computing, and adoption from big companies like Apple (SIRI), Amazon (Alexa), and Google, there were significant improvements in the performance and the products released to the market. Recent advances of neural models in speech\n","\n","The past six years of speech recognition has created more breakthroughs then the previous 40+ years. In order to understand the impact of deep learning and the part it plays, we need to understand first how speech recognition works. Although speech recognition has been in active research for almost 50 years, building machines that understand human speech is one of the most challenging problems in AI. This level is very similar to every machine learning task; in other words, given some data, we need to do proper data pre-processing and feature extraction. The impact is so far-reaching that even today, almost every solution in the field of speech recognition probably has one or more neural-based algorithms embedded within it. Usually the evaluation of speech recognition systems is based on an industry standard called Switchboard (SWBD). The evaluation of a speech recognition system is based on a metric called word error rate (WER). WER refers to how many words are misrecognized by the speech recognition system. Source: Yishay Carmiel. This development was a game changer for speech recognition, an almost 77% relative improvement. Now there are a wide range of applications, such as Apple SIRI, Amazon Alexa, Microsoft Cortana, and Google Now. Unfortunately, there isn’t a single method. Deep learning and speech recognition are so entangled that creating a state-of-the-art system involves a variety of different techniques and methods. Figure 4. Source: Yishay Carmiel. Creating a state-of-the-art system is not an easy task, and building it involves implementing and integrating all these different techniques into the system. Dealing with distant speech is a challenging problem that is being actively researched by a lot of groups. Generating synthesized data and training systems based on that is getting good attention today. Scalability\n","\n","Since deep learning is so entangled with speech recognition, it consumes a non-trivial amount of CPU and memory. As a result, there is research toward edge speech recognition that preserves the quality of a cloud-based system. The first problem is the issue of sensitivity to noise. A speech recognition system works pretty well from a close microphone and non-noisy environment; however, distant speech and noisy data degrades the system rapidly. Scaling the systems poses a tremendous challenge. In addition, we lack data on many languages, and a speech recognition system is difficult to create with low data resources. Or is a new solution waiting to be discovered? After all, the recent advances in speech recognition are just one piece of the puzzle: language understanding itself is a complex mystery—maybe an even greater one.\n","\n","Cancer detection, one slice at a time\n","=====================================\n","\n","Top N Summary\n","-------------\n","New technology is allowing researchers to use digitization to help detect cancer.

She ended up building the world’s largest online, preclinical pathology database, which catalyzes and could ultimately lead to the automated detection of cancer. The most common stain, H&E, is a mixture of an acidic dye (hematoxylin) and a basic one (eosin), which will stain cytoplasm pink and nuclei purple. But there are hundreds of “special stains” to detect tissue elements (e.g., muscle fibers, glycoproteins, and mucins), microorganisms (e.g., fungi and bacilli), or specific ions like ferric iron (Fe3+). While standard H&E staining is automated, using special stains or IHC can take significant time to optimize.

In RL, the goal is to learn how to map observations and measurements to a set of actions, while trying to maximize some long-term reward. Ray allows users to run simulations in parallel and comes with a Python API that makes it accessible for data scientists (Ray itself is written mainly in C++). Its creators have made it simple for others to use Python to write and run their own algorithms on top of Ray, including regular machine learning models. Why do you need a machine learning library and what algorithms are important for continuous learning? Recall that in RL one needs to learn how to map observations and measurements to a set of actions, while trying to maximize some long-term reward. Recent RL success stories mainly use gradient-based deep learning for this, but researchers have found that other optimization strategies such as evolution can be helpful. Unlike supervised learning where you start with training data and a target objective, in RL one only has sparse feedback, so techniques like neuroevolution become competitive with classic gradient descent. There are also other related algorithms that might become part of the standard collection of models used for continuous learning (e.g., counterfactual regret minimization used recently for poker). Most companies are still in the process of learning how to use and deploy standard (offline) machine learning, so perhaps discussing continuous learning is premature. As with any other new method or technology, the starting point is to identify uses cases where continuous learning potentially provides an advantage over existing offline approaches. The set of companies already using bandit algorithms (to recommend content or evaluate products) can probably quickly identify use cases and become early adopters.

In this article, and the accompanying notebook available on GitHub, I am going to introduce and walk through both the traditional reinforcement learning paradigm in machine learning as well as a new and emerging paradigm for extending reinforcement learning to allow for complex goals that vary over time. I will start by demonstrating how to build a simple Q-learning agent that is guided by a single reward signal to navigate an environment and make deliveries. To allow for greater flexibility, I will then describe how to build a class of reinforcement learning agents, which can optimize for various goals called “direct future prediction” (DFP). This value estimation should correspond to the discounted expected reward over time from taking action \\((a)\\) while in state \\((s)\\). Delivery drone scenario for goal-based RL\n","\n","Q-learning and other traditionally formulated reinforcement learning algorithms learn a single reward signal, and as such, can only pursue a single “goal” at a time. Take, for example, a situation in which we would like a drone to learn to deliver packages to various locations around a city. This “delivery drone” scenario will be our guiding paradigm in the discussion of goal-based RL going forward. If we want our drone to learn to deliver packages, we simply provide a positive reward of +1 for successfully flying to a marked location and making a delivery. Rendering of simple drone delivery environment. This can be considered something close to the optimal number of deliveries possible within 100 steps, given the size of the environment. Direct future prediction\n","\n","A real-world drone wouldn’t be able to endlessly deliver packages. With every movement, the agent’s battery charge will decrease slightly. Creating an optimal reward function\n","\n","Given enough time, and the correct hyperparameter tuning, the Q-learning algorithm could eventually discover that recharging the battery is beneficial to delivering more packages in the long-term. In the case of the battery, we can simply change the goal from “deliver packages” to “recharge battery” once the battery is below a certain capacity. Drone delivery environment with battery. In the paper, they refer to their network as “direct future prediction” (DFP). Diagram of a “direct future prediction” network from Dosovitskiy and Koltun (2016), used with permission.

Instead of predicting a value function like in Q-learning, we train our network to predict the expected future changes in battery and deliveries at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 steps into the future. If our agent were perfect at predicting the future measurements for each of these actions, we would simply need to take the action that optimized the measurements we were interested in. Formulating more complex goals\n","\n","Since we aren’t simply predicting a single scalar value estimate like in Q-learning, we can formulate more complex goals. Imagine that we have a measurement vector [battery, deliveries]. If we want to maximize battery charge but ignore deliveries, then our goal would be [1 , 0], which would correspond to desiring a positive battery measurement in the future and indifference to the number of deliveries. If we wanted to maximize deliveries, our goal would be [0, 1].

There are many inputs aside from information that create knowledge, and many inputs aside from knowledge that create wisdom and business value. From a machine learning and AI perspective, the hierarchy undergoes a weird recursion process. The inputs to an AI system are data; the processing of those inputs is data centric; and the outputs are, from the computer’s perspective, simply more data.

The future of work enhanced by data will enable us to focus on higher-level tasks. Logging error reports are meaningless if the logs are never looked at, and the information generated by a search engine or a classification model can’t become knowledge if it is never used. We build data systems and AI tools to support human needs, and we will always need humans to turn the potential insights provided by technology into real value.

I recently caught up with Silge and Robinson to discuss how they’re using text mining on job postings at Stack Overflow, some of the challenges and best practices they’ve experienced when mining text, and how their tidytext package for R aims to make text analysis both easy and informative. Why did you create the tidytext text mining package in R? We created the tidytext package because we believe in the power of tidy data principles, and we wanted to apply this consistent, opinionated approach for handling data to text mining tasks. Tidy tools like dplyr and ggplot2 are widely used, and integrating natural language processing into these tools allows R users to work with greater fluency. A word like “share” has a positive meaning in most contexts, but is neutral in financial contexts, where it usually refers to shares of stock. Applying the Loughran-McDonald lexicon allows us to explore the sentiment content of documents dealing with finance with more confidence. One example we deal with is text in job postings; we use text mining and modeling to match job listings with people who may be interested in them. Data scientists and analysts like us are usually trained on numerical data in a rectangular shape like a table (i.e., data frame), so it takes some practice to fluently wrangle raw text data. When your data is tidy, you can use a common set of tools for exploring and visualizing them. Using consistent tools designed for handling tidy data gives us a dependable framework for understanding how to represent text data in R, visualize the characteristics of text, model topics, and move smoothly to more complex machine learning applications. What is the difference between text mining and natural language processing? We describe our work as “text mining” because our goal is extracting and visualizing insights, but there is a great deal of overlap.\n","\n","Four short links: 26 July 2017\n","==============================\n","\n","Top N Summary\n","-------------\n","Blockchain and Securities Law, Low-Energy Sensing, Robotics Deep Learning, and Chipped Employees\n","\t\n","Report of Investigation ...
